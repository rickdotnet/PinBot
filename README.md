# Update 2024
Has Discord really not split this out already? This bot is old. I just realized it was running on a dusty server on a shelf in a shed. Then, I unplugged it unbeknownst to me. The first request I get to turn this back on, I will. Between now and then, I might redo it as well. Ew.

# PinBot
PinBot proof-of-concept. Why though? Because [of this](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360030264671 "Discord Support"), there still isn't an easy way to allow people to pin messages, without also allowing them to delete other messages. This solves that for now. I suspect they will eventually split this out, but until then... PinBot is here.

# How to use
Once someone is authorized, all they need to do is add a ðŸ“Œ reaction to a message and PinBot will do the rest.

# Disclaimer
This bot is still very early in development. It might never get finished. What it does do though, it should do well. Slash commands are VERY iffy right now. If they don't work at first, give Discord some time to propagate the commands down to your server. If they don't work after an hour see the contact details above.
